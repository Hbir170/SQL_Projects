# SQL Projects
This section details some of the projects I have done related to SQL to help hone and master my skills. I showcase my ability to import, preprocess, cleanse, organize and query data. I also show my ability to use CRUD functionalities and use aggregate functions to
grab data for complicated queries. I also show my ability to use Views and CTEs within these projects to bring about insights and prevent slowdown of the system by preventing the recurrent use of multiple codes by reducing them to a CTE. 

## Google Playstore Analysis
In this project, we take a dive into two CSV files relating to top Apps in Google Playstore relating to various devices. We clean the data, do an exploratory analysis, identify key variables such as Apps/Reviews/Ratings and Top Categories in order to help our client understand what differentiates popular apps from those that aren't. The end product is a PowerBI Dashboard (available in BI Section) which allows the potential client to understand how to launch their product, what categories to avoid, which ones bring the most
revenue potential and beyond.

## HR SQL Analysis
In this project we take a Human Resource Excel File and first clean it with SQL and then answer the main inquiries regarding the employees in the dataset. 
We focus on understanding the company well from a high level position and then dig deeper to see if any specific locations stand out regarding how long employees generally work there. There are various other
questions and key details we dig into in this dataset. The end result is a PowerBI dashboard (available in the BI section) which allows you to clearly see what the average person working in this company is like, their age, their likely department,
their average tenure within the company, race and many more important details which can help the company better understand their path for employee growth and highlight areas of improvement.
